# Infima Inputs &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/frankieali/infima-inputs/blob/main/LICENSE) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/infima-inputs.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/infima-inputs)

## Background

This is a supplemental library for the [Infima](https://infima.dev/) UI framework used extensively in [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Based on Infima [issue #100](https://github.com/facebookincubator/infima/issues/100) they do not currently have plans to supply form inputs for the framework due to Docusaurus' content-centric focus.

This library attempts to fill in the gaps by providing themes for form inputs. It is designed to extend Infima, and, as such, Infima should also be installed in any project that uses this library.

## Features

This library is scaffold in the same manner as [Infima](https://github.com/facebookincubator/infima). It has the same features as it's parent project, including light and dark modes.
