# Infima Extras &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/frankieali/infima-extras/blob/main/LICENSE) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/infima-extras.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/infima-extras)

## Background

This is a supplemental library for the [Infima](https://infima.dev/) UI framework used extensively in [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Based on Infima [issue #100](https://github.com/facebookincubator/infima/issues/100) they do not currently have plans to supply form extras for the framework due to Docusaurus' content-centric focus.

This library attempts to fill in the gaps by providing themes for form imputs and a few other UI feedback components. It is designed to extend Infima, and, as such, Infima should also be installed in any project that uses this library.

## Features

This library is scaffold in the same manner as [Infima](https://github.com/facebookincubator/infima). It has the same features as it's parent project, including light and dark modes.
